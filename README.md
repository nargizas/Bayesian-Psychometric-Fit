# Bayesian Methods in Estimating Detection Thresholds for Visuo-Haptic Illusions

This project explores the usage of Bayesian methods in estimating detection thresholds the visuo-haptic illusions in Virtual Reality (VR) environments. Particularly, the work focuses on determining the threshold at which users can detect the applied distortions in angle redirection and scaling up stimuli applied through foot-based shape displays.

## Objectives
- Compare Bayesian results with the previous frequentist approach.
- Investigate the change in detection thresholds when accounting for
    - Random effects
    - Guess and lapse rates

## Data
 The data was originally collected using the method of constant stimuli for the [research project](https://dl.designresearchsociety.org/iasdr/iasdr2023/fullpapers/164/) published at the IASDR conference.

## Report
The final project report summarizing the methods, results, and conclusions can be found in the `bayesian_analysis_report.pdf` file.
